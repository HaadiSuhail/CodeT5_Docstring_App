# CodeT5 Python Docstring Generator App

This is a Streamlit app that generates Python function docstrings using a fine-tuned [CodeT5-small](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5-small) model.  
The model was trained for **60k steps** using three filtered variations of the CodeSearchNet dataset to improve output quality on short to mid-length Python functions.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Paste raw Python function code in a text box
- Get an autogenerated docstring instantly
- Built with Streamlit + Hugging Face Transformers
- Locally loads a fine-tuned model (CodeT5-small @ 60k steps)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaadiSuhail/CodeT5_Docstring_App.git
cd CodeT5_Docstring_App
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Download the Fine-Tuned Model

ðŸ“¦ [Download model.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JMbOWERjgnuhGdhg-FFIQ_UccO2FQVfc/view?usp=drive_link)  
(Hosted on Google Drive)

Extract the zip file
Move the folder to a known location, e.g.:
/models/CodeT5-small-60k/checkpoint-60000/

Then, update this line in app.py:

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(
    "/models/CodeT5-small-60k/checkpoint-60000"
)

### 4. Run the App
streamlit run app.py

### ðŸ§ª Example

```python

# Input:
def count_vowels(text):
    return sum(1 for char in text if char.lower() in "aeiou")


# Output (Fine-tuned model):
Return the number of vowels in the given text.
```
