# CodeT5 Python Docstring Generator App

This is a Streamlit app that generates Python function docstrings using a fine-tuned [CodeT5-base](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5-base) model.  
The model was trained for **120k steps** using three filtered variations of the CodeSearchNet dataset to improve output quality on short to mid-length Python functions.

## âœ¨ Features

- Paste raw Python function code in a text box
- Get an autogenerated docstring instantly
- Built with Streamlit + Hugging Face Transformers
- Locally loads a fine-tuned model (CodeT5-base @ 120k steps)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaadiSuhail/CodeT5_Docstring_App.git
cd CodeT5_Docstring_App
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Download the Fine-Tuned Model

ðŸ“¦ [Download model.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19eJBTqI2Udy6ioceFsd5-UKGLeLiZ_BU/view?usp=sharing)  
(Hosted on Google Drive)

Extract the zip file
Move the folder to a known location, e.g.:
/model

Then, update this line in app.py:

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(
    "/model"
)

### 4. Run the App
streamlit run app.py

### ðŸ§ª Example

```python

# Input:
def factorial(n): 
    return 1 if n==0 else n*factorial(n-1)


# Output (Fine-tuned model):
Returns the factorial of the given number. Args: n (int): The number to factorial.
